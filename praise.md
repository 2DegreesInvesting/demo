Praise
================

The [praise package](https://github.com/rladies/praise) makes you and
others feel good.

``` r
library(praise)

praise()
#> [1] "You are superior!"
```

You can supply a template, and `praise()` fills in random words of the
specified part of speech:

``` r
praise("${EXCLAMATION}! You have done this ${adverb_manner}!")
#> [1] "HMM! You have done this quickly!"
```

Supported parts of speech:

``` r
lapply(praise_parts, head)
#> $adjective
#> [1] "ace"           "amazing"       "astonishing"   "astounding"
